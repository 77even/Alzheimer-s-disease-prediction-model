# Alzheimer-s-disease-prediction-model
Establishing a population prediction model for Alzheimer's disease based on brain MRI image processing

Objectives of this project:

(1)Development of a brain segmentation tool based on expectation-maximising Gaussian mixture models and Markov random fields as well as simulated intensity bias fields 

(2)Development of an automated segmentation tool for the left hippocampus based on a multi-graph segmentation propagation method and alignment registration

(3)Development of a Classifier Integrating Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Neural Networks to Predict Whether an Individual is Cognitively Normal, Suffers from Mild Cognitive Impairment,
or Suffers from Alzheimer's Disease
